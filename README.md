# **Time Series Forecasting with LSTM**

This repository contains code for time series forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model predicts future values based on historical data, showcasing its utility for sequential data such as stock prices, weather patterns, and more.

---

## **Features**
- Preprocessing of time series data for model training and testing.
- Implementation of an LSTM model for sequence prediction.
- Forecasting future values beyond the test dataset.
- Sliding window approach for updating input sequences with predicted values.
- Visualization of predictions for better interpretation.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
  ```

---

### **Running the Code**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-lstm.git
   cd time-series-lstm
   ```

2. Place your dataset in the appropriate location or use the built-in dataset logic.

3. Modify the parameters in the script as needed:
   - `seq_size`: Length of the input sequence.
   - `n_features`: Number of features in the data.
   - `future`: Number of steps to forecast into the future.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python forecast.py
   ```

## **Code Explanation**

### **Key Steps**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The input data is scaled and transformed into sequences of `seq_size` for model training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - An LSTM model is trained on the prepared data.
   - The architecture is designed to capture dependencies in sequential data.

3. **Forecasting**:
   - Predictions are made iteratively by sliding the input window forward and appending the latest predictions.

4. **Visualization**:
   - The actual and predicted values are plotted for comparison.

---

## **Example Output**
After running the code, you can expect outputs similar to:
- Training and validation loss during model training.
- Forecasted values plotted against actual data.

---

## **Customizations**
- **Change Dataset**:
  Update the data loading logic to work with your specific dataset.
- **Adjust Hyperparameters**:
  Modify parameters like sequence length, number of epochs, batch size, etc., for improved performance.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add support for multivariate time series data.
- Implement advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms.
- Provide more visualization options like error metrics and confidence intervals.
